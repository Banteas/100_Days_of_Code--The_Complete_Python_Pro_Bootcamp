# Day-19: Turtle Race Game 🐢🏁

This project is a simple race simulation built with Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
Six colorful turtles compete in a race, and the player can bet on which turtle will win.

---

## 🎮 How It Works
1. The program opens a window with a racetrack.
2. The player is asked to place a bet by entering a turtle color.
3. Six turtles (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) line up at the starting line.
4. The race begins! Each turtle moves forward by a random distance.
5. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
6. The result is printed in the console, showing if the player’s bet was correct.

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3 (standard installation is enough).
- No external packages are required — only the built-in `turtle` and `random` modules.

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Save the code in a file, for example `main.py`.
2. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Enter your bet in the popup window.
4. Watch the turtles race!
