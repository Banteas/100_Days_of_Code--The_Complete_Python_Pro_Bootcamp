🐢 Turtle Shape Drawer

A simple Python program that uses the turtle graphics library to draw polygons with different numbers of sides — from a triangle up to a decagon. Each shape is drawn in a random color, making the output fun and dynamic.

📸 Preview

When you run the program, you’ll see your turtle draw:

- A triangle, square, pentagon … all the way to a decagon

- Each shape in a different random color

- A playful, interactive drawing that stays open until you click

🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Built-in modules only (turtle and random)

No external dependencies are required.
